#Vescavor Swarm
Gibber	KEY:Vescavor Swarm ~ Gibber	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialQuality.Supernatural	DESC:Any creature within 15 feet of a vescavor swarm or inside it must succeed at a successful 15 Will save or be confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting compulsion insanity effect. A creature that saves cannot be affected by the same vescavor swarm's gibbering for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Ravenous	KEY:Vescavor Swarm ~ Ravenous	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Extraordinary	DESC:If a vescavor swarm attacks an object or structure, it ignores up to 19 points of hardness (hardness of 20 or higher applies in full). Every round a creature is in the same space as the swarm, the vescavors begin devouring one object on the creature. The object takes half its maximum hit points in damage and gains the broken condition. If the vescavors attack an object with the broken condition, it is destroyed. An attended or magic object can attempt a successful 15 Reflex save to negate this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Traumatizing	KEY:Vescavor Swarm ~ Traumatizing	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:SpecialAttack.Supernatural	DESC:Any creature that spends more than 3 rounds inside a vescavor swarm must succeed at DC 13 Will save or gain a type of madness (determined randomly from the list on page 250 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide). The save DC is Charisma-based.
